Throughout my life, I can remember walking into each of my computer science classes on the first day, from high school 
through college. A small portion of the lecture hall would be women, surrounded by men. In smaller classes, it was worse. 
There would be maybe two, or three other women in the room. Seeing the difference visually every day made my imposter 
syndrome worse.

In project groups, the moment we formed teams, the assumption was made: “You’re the design person, you can make the 
slides,” as if technical work were off-limits for me. 

I often think about the study done by Harvard Business Review: men will apply for jobs if they meet about 60% of the 
qualifications, while women tend to wait until they believe they meet 100%. Whether or not the numbers are exact, the 
underlying truth hits: we as women undersell ourselves, waiting for perfection before even trying to showcase our 
talents.

So I started pushing back. In group code reviews, I’d insist my pull requests get merged equally. If someone questioned 
my logic, I’d walk them through it, confidently. I stopped apologizing for asking questions or proposing design changes. 
If I felt sidelined in discussions, I’d interrupt with my thoughts the way they all did.

I also found the courage to reach out to the other women in class. We’d swap notes, commiserate, cheer each other on. 
Those friendships became our biggest strength in our classes. Slowly, I internalized what I already know: my perspective, 
my work, my questions all have value. I belong here because I earned it and refuse to cede it.
