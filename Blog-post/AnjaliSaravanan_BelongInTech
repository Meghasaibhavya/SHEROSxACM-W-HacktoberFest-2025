Title: The First Time I Realized I Belonged in Tech
Author: Anjali Saravanan

I started college with just one thought: “Computers are not my cup of tea.” I loved Biology in high school, and being so 
passionate about it, I always believed that I would become a doctor — but I guess I was wrong. 
I knew almost nothing about computers or technology when I began my bachelor’s degree in computer science. 
It was a rough start — I couldn’t understand how an operating system worked, how data was stored, 
or even why programming languages were designed and structured the way they were. For a while, 
I felt like I didn’t belong in tech and maybe I made the wrong decision. But as time passed and 
I started to get the hang of things, I realized that computer science isn’t just about writing code — it’s about analyzing 
and solving complex problems.

It was during my final year project that I discovered my passion for technology, 
especially Data Analytics. Looking back, my journey from dreaming of becoming a doctor to 
working as a Data Analytics expert alongside industrial experts feels like a huge accomplishment. 
This journey taught me many things, but the most important one was that sometimes the path we never plan to 
take leads us exactly where we’re meant to be.
