Title: Imposter Syndrome and How I'm Learning to Challenge It
Author: Sesmi Athiyarath

When I first learned that I'd won the Excellence Award at the company where I worked, under the category of Future Shaper of the Year, my immediate reaction wasn't pride or excitement. It was disbelief!

I remember staring at the announcement, wondering if there had been a mistake. Did I really deserve this? I could think of so many others who are as smart as me — maybe even smarter. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt accepting the recognition.

That's when I realized what I was feeling wasn't humility — it was imposter syndrome. The quiet fear that maybe my success was luck, timing, or people overestimating my abilities.

But over the days that followed, messages from teammates and mentors started pouring in. They reminded me of the projects I had worked on, the challenges I had solved, and the impact I had created. Hearing their perspective helped me see what I had been too critical to recognize in myself.

Slowly, I started to accept that being recognized didn't mean I was claiming to be perfect — it meant others saw potential and effort that I often overlooked.

If you ever find yourself doubting whether you've "earned" your success, pause and listen to the people who believe in you. Sometimes, they see the version of you that you're still growing into.

Today, I'm learning to say "thank you" instead of "I don't deserve this." Because acceptance isn't arrogance — it's acknowledging your journey and giving yourself permission to keep shaping the future with confidence.
