               Ensemble Methods – Combining multiple weak learners into one strong decision-maker.

Imagine a group of friends working on a school project that must be presented in front of an audience. 
Each friend has their own strength — one might be great at designing slides, another at coordinating the team, 
one at brainstorming ideas, and another at organizing the information. When they all work together, 
the project turns out amazing — much better than if just one person did everything alone.

This is exactly how ensemble methods work in machine learning. Instead of relying on a single model to make predictions, 
we combine multiple smaller models, called weak learners. By combining their individual strengths, 
the ensemble creates a model that is much more accurate and reliable.

In short, ensemble methods are team work among models, just like a group of friends working together to 
create a successful project.
